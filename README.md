GameAutoMaker
=============

Analyses sprite and input data, uses that to figure out the basic rules of the
game, and then makes a new game based on those rules. Combine data from
different games to create groundbreaking new genres.

Comes with a NES emulator (by [bfirsh](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes)) already 
set up to output data.
